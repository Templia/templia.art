# Welcome

You have arrived at Templia at a meaningful moment in your journey, Cyd. It is not a coincidence. The Maya understood that every day carries its own living energy — and the days of your stay were chosen long before you were.

What follows is a guide to the energies present during your time at Templia — a map of the currents, symbols, and intentions that accompany you while you are in the land of the Maya.

# Day 1 — 2026-02-25

## The Jaguar's Threshold

Ix is the Jaguar — the earth force, the feminine power that moves through the jungle unseen, the mystery that cannot be captured or named. Ix is the shamanic sign, the one who sees in the dark, who walks between worlds without fear. The number 8 (Wajxaq) brings harmony, a sense of fullness and abundance. You arrive on a day of great power — the Jaguar is at the threshold, holding the door open, watching you cross.

### Activities

- **Arrival**: Come to Templia and walk the jungle garden slowly. Do not hurry. The Jaguar is here — in the roots of the trees, in the sound of the wind moving through the canopy. Place your feet on the earth and feel the land receive you.
- **Late Afternoon**: Sit by the Mayan firepit as the sun descends. Ix is the protector of sacred spaces. You are entering a protected one. Light a candle or simply breathe with intention — mark this arrival as something more than travel.
- **Evening**: Dinner in Aldea Zama — let yourself wander without a fixed restaurant in mind. Ix teaches that the most powerful paths are the ones that find you, not the ones you plan.
- **Night**: Steam shower ritual at Templia. Let the heat open your pores and your perception. Before sleep, ask yourself: what am I willing to see that I have been avoiding? Ix rewards honest sight.

# Day 2 — 2026-02-26

## The Eagle's Horizon

Tz'ikin is the Eagle — the great visionary, the one who sees from above the fray, who holds the panoramic view when all others are caught in the details. It carries the energy of freedom, of prosperity that comes from clarity of vision. The number 9 (B'elejeb') is the number of patience, of what has been cultivated and is ready to be seen. Today, let the Eagle show you what your ordinary sight has been missing.

### Activities

- **Sunrise**: Rise early and go to the rooftop or any high point. Look at the sky turning. Tz'ikin begins in the east with the sun. Let the light land on you before you begin the day.
- **Morning**: Visit Tulum Ruins at dawn. The clifftop temple called Zama — "dawn" — was built precisely to see from above, to hold the view the Eagle holds. Walk among the structures slowly. What does the landscape reveal from this height?
- **Midday**: Swim at a beachfront cenote or Tulum's Caribbean shore. The Eagle dives as well as soars — immerse yourself completely.
- **Afternoon**: Rest at Templia. Hammock, agua de coco, the dappled light of the garden. Let the morning's visions settle. Prosperity in the Tzolkin tradition is not material — it is clarity. Rest is part of seeing clearly.
- **Evening**: Journal what you observed today — at the ruins, in the water, in the reflections. The Eagle's vision is wasted if it is not remembered.

# Day 3 — 2026-02-27

## The Owl's Council

Ajmaq is the Owl — the keeper of ancient wisdom, the one who carries the voices of the ancestors, the energy of forgiveness and deep knowing. In Maya tradition, Ajmaq holds the memory of what has been forgotten, and offers it back to those who are ready. The number 10 (Lajuj) is the number of manifestation, of what becomes real when intention meets the earth. Today is for listening to what has long been trying to reach you.

### Activities

- **Morning**: Move slowly. Ajmaq does not rush. Sit in Templia's garden with coffee or tea and simply listen — to the birds, the insects, the rustle of leaves. What pattern keeps repeating? The ancestors speak in repetition.
- **Midday**: Visit Parque del Jaguar — walk the jungle trails where ancient Maya walked. The park holds the bones of the old world beneath its roots. Walk without headphones, without a map. Let the path choose you.
- **Afternoon**: Museum visit — Museo Regional de la Costa Oriental (Mureco) inside Parque del Jaguar. Stand before the artifacts. These objects were touched by hands that carried the same questions you carry. Feel the continuity.
- **Evening**: Write a letter — to someone you need to forgive, or to a younger version of yourself. You don't have to send it. Ajmaq asks only that the words be spoken inwardly. Burn it at the firepit if you wish. The smoke carries what cannot be said aloud.

# Day 4 — 2026-02-28

## The Mind That Moves the Mountain

No'j is the Earthquake — the day sign of the great thinker, the mind that perceives the unseen structures beneath the surface of things. No'j carries the energy of knowledge, of intellectual breakthrough, of the idea that shifts the ground underfoot. The number 11 (Julajuj) is the number of resolution, of what finally finds its form after long preparation. Today your mind is the instrument — let it work.

### Activities

- **Morning**: Take a long walk without a destination. No'j thinks best when the body is moving. Let your mind move freely — don't force answers, let questions walk with you through Aldea Zama or along the Tulum beach road.
- **Midday**: Cenote visit — Gran Cenote or Cenote Escondido. Descend into the earth's interior. No'j is the energy of what moves beneath — the tectonic shift, the underground river. Let the cenote's underworld geography hold your thinking.
- **Afternoon**: Write, read, or create something. No'j is the most intellectual day sign — it needs output. Sketch a map of your life. List the questions that have no answers yet. Sometimes the act of naming a question is the breakthrough.
- **Evening**: Light meal at Templia. Sit with the ideas of the day. The Earthquake does not destroy — it reorganizes. What is being reorganized in you?

# Day 5 — 2026-03-01

## The Obsidian Mirror

Tijax is the Obsidian blade — the surgical truth-teller, the healer who cuts away what no longer serves, the mirror that shows what we have been avoiding seeing. In Maya tradition, obsidian was the material of sacrifice and reflection — the blade that opens the wound and the mirror that reveals the self. The number 12 (Kab'lajuj) brings complexity and integration, the weaving of many threads. Today calls for radical honesty.

### Activities

- **Morning**: Cold plunge in Templia's pool at dawn. Tijax is sharp and clarifying — let the cold water be the blade. Breathe through the shock. What becomes clear in the cold?
- **Midday**: Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve day trip — one of the most pristine ecosystems on the Yucatán. Boat through mangrove channels, float in crystalline lagoons. Tijax heals through nature's precision — the mangrove knows exactly where to root, the current knows exactly where to flow.
- **Afternoon**: Return to Templia. Rest deeply. After a journey of healing, the body needs stillness.
- **Evening**: At the firepit, reflect: what has been cut away this week? What old story have you left behind? Tijax asks us to name what we've released. Name it, thank it, and let the smoke carry it.

# Day 6 — 2026-03-02

## The Sacred Storm

Kawoq is the Storm — the divine feminine force of purification, the rain that washes the old world away and makes space for the new. Kawoq carries the energy of community, of the collective healing that happens when people gather around a shared fire. The number 13 (Oxlajuj) is the most sacred number in the Tzolkin — the completion of the tonal cycle, the return to source. Today holds the energy of sacred completion and communal renewal.

### Activities

- **Morning**: Visit the Caribbean sea — not to swim, but to stand at the edge and look out. Kawoq comes from the ocean. The Maya understood the sea as the source of all rain, all purification. Let the sound of the waves be your morning ceremony.
- **Midday**: Lunch at a restaurant in Tulum Pueblo or Aldea Zama that you share with strangers or friends — a communal table, a lively kitchen, a place where conversation happens naturally. Kawoq is the energy of community. Be with people today.
- **Afternoon**: Templia pool ritual — float on your back and look at the sky. The Storm has passed. You are in the clearing that comes after. Let the water hold the weight of everything you have been carrying.
- **Evening**: Cook together at Templia if you are traveling with others, or prepare a simple meal with intention for yourself. Kawoq's energy is domestic and sacred — the hearth, the shared meal, the fire that brings people together.

# Day 7 — 2026-03-03

## The Solar Returning

Ajpu is the Sun — the hunter and the hero, the one who descended into the underworld and returned with the light intact. In the Popol Vuh, the Maya creation story, it is the Hero Twins Hunahpu (Ajpu) who defeat the lords of death and become the sun and moon. The number 1 (Jun) is the seed, the beginning, the singular point from which all things emerge. Today the cycle begins again — new, luminous, and whole.

### Activities

- **Sunrise**: Wake before dawn and watch the sun rise. Ajpu is the sun itself — witnessing its return today is not a small gesture. It is the entire mythology of the Maya enacted in a moment. Stand facing east. Let the light find you.
- **Morning**: Physical activity — swim, walk, stretch, move. The Hero Twins were athletes. The Maya ballgame was a cosmic ritual. Move your body as if the movement matters to the cosmos, because in the Tzolkin, it does.
- **Midday**: Visit a local market or Tulum's artisanal shops. Ajpu carries the energy of creation and skill — support local makers. The hero always returns with gifts.
- **Afternoon**: Rest and reflection at Templia. You are halfway through this journey. What hero's journey have you been on? What have you descended into and what are you carrying back?
- **Evening**: Celebrate. Ajpu is not subtle — it is radiant. Let this evening be joyful, generous, alive. The sun does not ration its light.

# Day 8 — 2026-03-04

## The Primordial Waters

Imox is the first day sign — the cosmic womb, the primordial sea from which all creation stirs. It is the energy of intuition before thought, of the unconscious tide that moves the dreamer. Imox does not reason — it feels, it flows, it surrenders to the current. The number 2 (Ki) carries the energy of duality, of the pair, of what is held in dynamic balance. Today is for feeling over thinking.

### Activities

- **Morning**: Sacred cenote swim — descend into the earth's oldest water. Imox is the primordial sea; the cenotes are its inland mirrors. Float without swimming. Let the water hold you completely.
- **Midday**: Unstructured time at Templia. Follow impulse over plan. If you feel like drawing, draw. If you feel like sleeping, sleep. If you feel like talking to a stranger, talk. Imox is not a day for agendas.
- **Afternoon**: Walk to the beach or through the jungle slowly, without a destination. Notice what draws your attention — a color, a sound, a feeling in your chest. Imox communicates through sensation, not thought.
- **Evening**: Meditate or breathe at the firepit. Let the day's impressions settle like sediment in still water. Before sleep, hold a question in your mind without trying to answer it. Let the night waters bring what they bring.

# Day 9 — 2026-03-05

## The Breath Between Worlds

Iq' is the Wind — the breath of life, the invisible force that animates everything it touches. In Maya tradition, Iq' is the spirit itself — the divine intelligence that moves through creation, that speaks through sudden gusts and unexpected arrivals. The number 3 (Oxib') is the number of movement, of the triangle, of what is activated and begins to flow. Today, let yourself be moved.

### Activities

- **Morning**: Breathwork or pranayama practice — simple, intentional breathing. Iq' is the breath before all else. Take ten deliberate, conscious breaths facing the wind's direction. You are calling the spirit.
- **Morning**: Visit Tulum Ruins one final time, or a different archaeological site — Cobá, Muyil, or the ruins at Sian Ka'an. Iq' carried messages between cities in the ancient world. These stones are still transmitting. Listen.
- **Afternoon**: Creative expression — write, paint, sing, or speak aloud what this journey has been. Iq' is communication. Something wants to be said through you today. Let it.
- **Evening**: Open the doors and windows of Templia. Let the wind move through the house. Cook or order a meal that smells extraordinary — the breath carries scent as its first language. Eat slowly. Breathe with intention.

# Day 10 — 2026-03-06

## The Dawn Inside the Dark

Aq'ab'al is the Night — the moment just before dawn, the threshold between darkness and light, the womb of the new day. It is not the darkness of fear but the darkness of potential — the seed underground, the dream not yet woken. The number 4 (Kaj) brings stability, the four corners of the world, the solid foundation. On your final full day, Aq'ab'al holds you in the liminal — the in-between — and asks: what will you bring with you into the light?

### Activities

- **Pre-Dawn**: Wake before sunrise. Sit in the dark at Templia — in the garden, at the firepit, anywhere outside. Let yourself be in the night for a few minutes before the world begins again. Aq'ab'al lives in this moment.
- **Sunrise**: Watch the light return. This is the most important activity of the day. The dawn that Aq'ab'al holds is the metaphor for every renewal — what has been dark is about to be illuminated.
- **Morning**: Slow breakfast. Write in your journal — what do you carry forward from these ten days? What stays here, in the jungle?
- **Midday**: Final cenote or beach visit. A last immersion in the sacred water of the Yucatán.
- **Afternoon**: Pack with intention at Templia. Aq'ab'al's stability (the 4) means you leave with a foundation, not a fragment. What is solid in you now that wasn't solid when you arrived?
- **Evening**: Dinner and the firepit one last time. The night holds its gifts willingly. Take what is yours.

# Day 11 — 2026-03-07

## Departure

The Jaguar opened your journey and the dawn held your final night. You leave with the medicine of ten days woven into your body — vision, wisdom, knowledge, truth, purification, solar light, primordial water, wind, and the promise of renewal. The land of the Maya does not release its visitors unchanged.

### Activities

- **Early Morning**: Write one sentence — what this journey was. Not a summary. A seed.
- **Water Ritual**: Stand at Templia's pool or hold water in both hands. Thank the cenotes, the sea, and the jungle for holding you. Let the water receive one final offering of gratitude.
- **Departure**: Pack lightly in spirit. The Jaguar who greeted you is watching as you leave — not to hold you back, but to bless the road ahead.

# Integration

## From Mystery to Dawn: Ten Days in the Sacred Count

Your ten days at Templia moved through one of the most powerful sequences the Tzolkin offers — from the Jaguar's unseen earth force all the way through the Sun's heroic return, then back to the primordial waters, the breath of life, and the promise of the new dawn. Each day was a distinct intelligence, and together they formed a complete arc.

- **8 Ix** (The Jaguar): The earth force received you at the threshold. Mystery was the first teacher.
- **9 Tz'ikin** (The Eagle): Vision opened from above — you were invited to see your life from the wider horizon.
- **10 Ajmaq** (The Owl): The ancestors offered their wisdom. Forgiveness was the medicine available.
- **11 No'j** (The Earthquake): The great thinker moved through you — ideas shifted, ground reorganized beneath old assumptions.
- **12 Tijax** (The Obsidian): The surgical blade of truth cut cleanly. Something was released that had grown too heavy.
- **13 Kawoq** (The Storm): The cycle completed itself in sacred purification. The divine feminine washed the old world clean.
- **1 Ajpu** (The Sun): The hero returned from the underworld. A new cycle began with the light of wholeness.
- **2 Imox** (The Crocodile): The primordial waters received you back to the beginning — into intuition, into the body's oldest knowing.
- **3 Iq'** (The Wind): The breath moved everything. Spirit spoke through wind and word and unexpected arrival.
- **4 Aq'ab'al** (The Night): The stable darkness held the promise of dawn — and gave you the four-cornered foundation to carry forward.

### Closing

Ten days is a rare gift — long enough to be changed by a place, not just visited by it. You arrived under the Jaguar's mystery and you leave under the Night's promise of dawn. Between those two thresholds, the sacred calendar gave you its sharpest tools: the Eagle's vision, the Owl's ancestral memory, the Earthquake's intellectual force, the Obsidian's surgical truth, the Storm's purifying rain, the Sun's heroic light, the Crocodile's primordial intuition, and the Wind's living breath. What the Maya knew — and what Templia holds in trust — is that time is not empty. Every day is a living intelligence. You have spent ten days inside that intelligence. It will not leave you.
