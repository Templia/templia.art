# Welcome

You have arrived at Templia at a meaningful moment in your journey, Jake. It is not a coincidence. The Maya understood that every day carries its own living energy — and the days of your stay were chosen long before you were.

What follows is a guide to the energies present during your time at Templia — a map of the currents, symbols, and intentions that accompany you while you are in the land of the Maya.

# Day 1 — 2026-03-09

## The Gift of the Ancestors

Kame is Death — not as ending, but as transformation. It is the most misunderstood day sign in the Tzolkin, and the most powerful. Kame is the energy of the ancestors, of the great transition, of the chrysalis that must dissolve completely before the new form can emerge. The number 7 (Wuq) is the mystical center of the Tzolkin, the column of sacred alignment. You arrive on a day that asks you to let something die — not violently, but with the grace of the seed that surrenders its shell to become what it was always meant to be.

### Activities

- **Arrival**: Come to Templia and stand in the jungle garden. Feel the weight of whatever you have been carrying — the old identity, the exhausted pattern, the story that no longer fits. Kame is not asking you to fight. It is asking you to release.
- **Late Afternoon**: Sit by the Mayan firepit as dusk comes. In Maya tradition, Kame is honored with candles and offerings to the ancestors. Light a candle here. Think of those who came before you — what did they carry so you wouldn't have to? What did they give you that you have not yet claimed?
- **Evening**: Dinner in Aldea Zama — let the meal be a celebration of transition, not a mourning. Kame is not sad. It is the most honest energy in the calendar. What you release tonight creates space for what arrives tomorrow.
- **Night**: Steam shower ritual at Templia. Let the heat be the chrysalis. Before sleep, write one sentence: what are you willing to leave behind in this jungle?

# Day 2 — 2026-03-10

## The Four Pillars of Harmony

Kej is the Deer — the guardian of the four pillars of the sky, the keeper of the cosmic balance, the one who moves through the forest with a grace that never disturbs what it passes. In Maya tradition, Kej holds the world upright — its four legs are the four cardinal directions, the four sacred mountains, the four corners of the sky. The number 8 (Wajxaq) brings abundant harmony. On the morning after release, the Deer walks you into a world that has been reorganized by last night's letting go.

### Activities

- **Sunrise**: Wake early and face each of the four directions in turn — east, north, west, south. Breathe once in each direction. Kej holds the four corners. You are placing yourself at the center.
- **Morning**: Parque del Jaguar — walk the jungle trails slowly. The Deer is a creature of the forest. Move without urgency, without a destination. Notice where the path feels right and follow it.
- **Midday**: Sacred cenote swim. Descent into the earth's interior is the complement to the Deer's surface grace — go deep, then return. Let the cold water complete what the heat began last night.
- **Afternoon**: Rest at Templia. Hammock, shade, the sound of the jungle settling into afternoon stillness. Kej does not rush. Harmony is not achieved — it is allowed.
- **Evening**: Light meal, long conversation, or quiet reflection at the firepit. The Deer has brought you into balance. Feel where you are — not behind, not ahead, but here.

# Day 3 — 2026-03-11

## The Seed That Knows What It Will Become

Q'anil is the Seed — the day sign of fertility, of creative potential coiled so tightly it becomes heat, of the thing that is complete before it has begun. Q'anil holds all four colors of maize: red, black, white, yellow — the full spectrum of creation compressed into one small form. The number 9 (B'elejeb') is the number of patience, of what has been tended through the long darkness and is now ready to show itself. On your departure morning, the Seed reminds you: everything you need for what comes next is already inside you.

### Activities

- **Early Morning**: Write in your journal — what seed did this journey plant? What is coiled in you now that wasn't coiled three days ago? Q'anil does not need the harvest to prove its worth. The seed is the miracle.
- **Morning**: Final cenote or beach immersion — a last contact with the sacred water of the Yucatán. Let the water bless what has been planted.
- **Water Ritual**: Hold water in both hands at Templia's pool or garden. Thank the land, the jungle, the cenotes, and the sea. An offering of gratitude to the forces that held space for your transformation.
- **Departure**: Pack with the knowledge that you leave with more than you arrived with — not as luggage, but as seed. The fertile potential of these three days travels with you. Tend it.

# Integration

## Death, Deer, and Seed: Three Days of Sacred Becoming

Your three days moved through one of the most complete arcs the Tzolkin offers in compressed form — release, balance, and fertile new beginning. The sacred calendar chose these days with precision.

- **7 Kame** (Death): The mystical center held space for transformation. What was ready to end, ended — not violently, but with the grace of the ancestors who know that every ending is a doorway.
- **8 Kej** (The Deer): Harmony arrived on the morning after release. The four pillars steadied the world that had been reorganized by letting go. The forest received you.
- **9 Q'anil** (The Seed): Patience and potential coiled together. Everything that was released, balanced, and walked through these three days compressed itself into a seed that now travels with you.

### Closing

Three days is not a short stay — it is the complete arc of transformation, integration, and planting. You arrived under the ancestors' watch and you leave carrying a seed whose harvest has not yet been revealed. What the Maya knew is that the seed does not need to understand what it will become. It only needs the right conditions — warmth, water, good soil. Templia provided the conditions. The jungle held the ceremony. The rest unfolds in your days ahead.
