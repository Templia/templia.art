# Welcome

You have arrived at Templia at a meaningful moment in your journey, Tara. It is not a coincidence. The Maya understood that every day carries its own living energy — and the days of your stay were chosen long before you were.

What follows is a guide to the energies present during your time at Templia — a map of the currents, symbols, and intentions that accompany you while you are in the land of the Maya.

# Day 1 — 2026-03-12

## The Sacred Fire of Gratitude

Toj is the Offering — the day sign of gratitude, of sacred fire, of the payment made not out of obligation but out of recognition that everything received deserves acknowledgment. In Maya tradition, Toj is the energy of reciprocity: the universe gives, and we give back. The number 10 (Lajuj) is the number of manifestation, of what becomes real when intention meets the earth. You arrive on a day that asks a simple and profound question: what are you grateful for? Not in the abstract — specifically, deeply, out loud.

### Activities

- **Arrival**: Come to Templia and walk through the space slowly. Touch the walls, feel the floor, look at the canopy above. This is the offering the land has prepared for you. Receive it consciously.
- **Late Afternoon**: Sit by the Mayan firepit. Toj is the fire itself — the sacred flame that receives our offerings and transforms them into light. Watch the fire. Name three things, aloud or silently, that you are genuinely grateful for. Not the polite answers — the real ones.
- **Evening**: Dinner in Aldea Zama — choose a restaurant where the food comes from the land nearby. Toj honors the chain of giving from earth to table to body. Eat with attention.
- **Night**: Steam shower ritual. Let the heat be the first offering of the journey — your tension, your fatigue, your travel-weight — released into the steam. Before sleep, ask: what would I create if I truly trusted that the universe was giving me everything I need?

# Day 2 — 2026-03-13

## The Keeper of Justice

Tz'i' is the Dog — the loyal guardian, the keeper of justice, the one who walks the path without wavering. In Maya tradition, Tz'i' is the day of the law — not human law, but the deeper law that governs what is true and what endures. The Dog does not deceive and cannot be deceived. The number 11 (Julajuj) brings resolution, the long arc of things finally finding their form. Today asks you to walk with integrity — to say what is true, to do what you said you would do, to trust the steady path beneath your feet.

### Activities

- **Morning**: Tulum Ruins at dawn. The Dog is the guardian of sacred places — enter this one with respect and intention. Walk the perimeter of the clifftop slowly. What has been guarding you throughout your life? What loyalty have you been showing — to others, to yourself?
- **Midday**: Sacred cenote swim — Gran Cenote or Cenote Calavera. Tz'i' is associated with water and the underworld passages in Maya cosmology. The cenote is the Dog's sacred domain. Descend with gratitude (yesterday's energy is still moving).
- **Afternoon**: Rest at Templia. Journal — what are you truly committed to? Not the aspirational answers, but the ones you already live. Tz'i' honors what is already real and faithful in you.
- **Evening**: Long walk through Aldea Zama at dusk. Move slowly, without agenda. The Dog knows the neighborhood — every corner, every alley, every face. Become familiar with this place you are temporarily calling home.

# Day 3 — 2026-03-14

## The Weaver at the Loom

B'atz' is the Monkey — the master weaver, the supreme artisan, the one who holds the thread of time itself and knows what connects the beginning to the end. In the Tzolkin, B'atz' is the most sacred day for ceremony — it is the day the count began, the day the weaver first took up the thread. The number 12 (Kab'lajuj) brings rich complexity, the layered weaving of many colors. Today is for making — with your hands, your words, your attention, your imagination.

### Activities

- **Morning**: Creative time first — before coffee, before conversation if possible. B'atz' rises with creation. Write, sketch, photograph, play music, build something with your hands. Don't edit. The weaver does not stop mid-thread to evaluate.
- **Midday**: Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve — a day trip into the most pristine landscape of the Yucatán peninsula. Boat through mangrove channels, walk ancient Maya trading routes, float in the crystalline lagoons. B'atz' sees the weave in the natural world — the network of roots, the pattern of migration, the thread of the current.
- **Afternoon**: Return to Templia. The afternoon is for integration — let the morning's creativity and the biosphere's complexity settle together. Rest in the hammock. Let the monkey play without agenda.
- **Evening**: Light the Mayan firepit. Reflect on what patterns you noticed today — in the mangroves, in the water, in your own creative process. Cook a meal intentionally. The weaver knows that preparation is part of the art.

# Day 4 — 2026-03-15

## The Road That Finds You

E is the Road — the sacred path of destiny, the journey itself made holy. It is not a road you build or choose — it is the road that recognizes you and reveals itself beneath your feet when you are walking with your whole self. The number 13 (Oxlajuj) is the completion of the tonal cycle, the most sacred number in the Tzolkin — the moment when the count returns to its source. On your final full day, E holds the most powerful energy available: the destined road at its fullest expression.

### Activities

- **Morning**: Walk without a plan. E teaches that the road reveals itself to those who move with presence, not those who map their steps in advance. Leave Templia and walk through Aldea Zama, the jungle paths, wherever your feet go. Trust entirely.
- **Midday**: Visit Parque del Jaguar — walk the trails where the ancient Maya walked. These paths were trading routes, pilgrimage routes, the living road of civilization. You are walking on E. Feel the weight of all the feet that preceded yours.
- **Afternoon**: Museo Regional de la Costa Oriental (Mureco) inside Parque del Jaguar. The road of the Maya led through these objects — the tools, the ceremonial pieces, the domestic things. Every artifact is a footstep on the road of a life. Stand before them and feel the continuity.
- **Evening**: Final dinner in Tulum — choose wherever the road takes you. E doesn't need a reservation. Trust. Before sleep, look at the intention you arrived with. Has the road of four days shaped it into something truer?

# Day 5 — 2026-03-16

## Departure

The offering you made on arrival has been received. The Dog walked with you faithfully. The Monkey wove your days into a pattern that only becomes visible from this distance. And now the Road — the most sacred energy in the calendar — releases you. You leave as someone who has walked the destined path, even for four days.

### Activities

- **Early Morning**: Write — what was woven this week that wasn't woven before? What thread did you pick up that you didn't expect to find?
- **Water Ritual**: Stand at Templia's pool or hold water in both hands. Thank the land, the fire, the cenotes, and the road. An offering of gratitude to the forces that walked with you.
- **Departure**: Leave with lightness. The road continues past Tulum. E doesn't end — it goes on, and on, and on, carrying you toward what you were always becoming.

# Integration

## Offering, Loyalty, Weaving, Road: A Complete Journey

Your four days moved through one of the most coherent arcs in the sacred count — from the gratitude of sacred fire, through the faithfulness of the guardian, into the artisan's creative weaving, and out onto the destined road. Each day prepared the ground for the next.

- **10 Toj** (The Offering): Sacred fire received your arrival with gratitude and reciprocity. The first day established the terms: give and receive honestly.
- **11 Tz'i'** (The Dog): Loyal justice walked beside you. The path demanded integrity and rewarded it with clarity.
- **12 B'atz'** (The Monkey): The master weaver took all the threads — the offering, the loyalty, the creative impulse — and wove them into something larger than any single day could hold.
- **13 E** (The Road): At the completion of the tonal cycle, the destined road revealed itself. You did not choose this path — it chose you.

### Closing

Four days in the sacred count is a complete teaching. The Offering gave you the frame: life is reciprocal. The Dog gave you the method: walk with integrity. The Monkey gave you the art: weave meaning from what you are given. And the Road gave you the destination: not a place, but a way of moving through all places. What you carry forward from Templia is not a memory of Tulum — it is a thread from the Weaver's loom, a step from the Dog's faithful path, a flicker of the sacred fire that received your first honest gratitude. The road continues. Walk well.
