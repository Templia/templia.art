# Welcome

You have arrived at Templia at a meaningful moment in your journey, Lingwei. It is not a coincidence. The Maya understood that every day carries its own living energy — and the days of your stay were chosen long before you were.

What follows is a guide to the energies present during your time at Templia — a map of the currents, symbols, and intentions that accompany you while you are in the land of the Maya.

# Day 1 — 2026-03-21

## The Obsidian Mirror

Tijax is the Obsidian blade — the most precise instrument in the Maya world, used for surgery, for sacrifice, and for scrying. It is the day sign of healing through truth, of the cut that cures, of the mirror so dark and clear that it shows what ordinary light conceals. Tijax does not comfort — it clarifies. The number 6 (Waq) brings flowing balance, the equilibrium of what has been allowed to find its natural level. You arrive on a day when the most generous thing the universe can offer you is complete honesty.

### Activities

- **Arrival**: Come to Templia and spend fifteen minutes alone in the garden before anything else. Tijax asks for an honest first encounter with this place — not the performed excitement of arrival, but the real feeling in your body when you step into the jungle space. What do you actually feel?
- **Late Afternoon**: Cenote visit — descend into the earth's interior. Obsidian was formed from volcanic fire and cooled in water. The cenote is its counterpart: the dark mirror of still water, the underground chamber where things become clear. Look at your reflection in the water.
- **Evening**: Dinner in Aldea Zama — choose without overthinking. Tijax cuts through indecision. The first restaurant that draws you is the right one.
- **Night**: Steam shower ritual at Templia. Let the heat open what the obsidian mirror showed. Before sleep, write one sentence: what truth did today show you that you have been avoiding?

# Day 2 — 2026-03-22

## The Sacred Storm

Kawoq is the Storm — the great purifying rain, the divine feminine force that moves through communities, through families, through the body's deep interior. Kawoq carries the energy of collective healing, of the home made sacred, of the water cycle itself: what evaporates returns as rain, what falls nourishes what rises. The number 7 (Wuq) is the mystical center, the axis of the sacred calendar. On the morning after the Obsidian's honest revelation, the Storm arrives to wash the old away and prepare the ground for what is new.

### Activities

- **Sunrise**: Stand in the open air and feel whatever weather has come. Kawoq's storm is not always literal — it may arrive as sudden emotion, unexpected connection, a dream that surfaces at waking. Receive it.
- **Morning**: Parque del Jaguar — walk the jungle trails in the morning light. After rain, the jungle smells of the most ancient earth on the planet. Kawoq lives in this scent. Breathe deeply. Move slowly.
- **Midday**: Visit Museo Regional de la Costa Oriental (Mureco) inside Parque del Jaguar. Kawoq is the day sign of the home — these objects were the contents of Maya homes and temples. Stand before them and feel the domestic sacred: the cooking vessel, the ceremonial blade, the figure of the divine. The home is the first temple.
- **Afternoon**: Return to Templia. Float in the pool. Kawoq is the water that purifies — let the pool complete what the cenote began yesterday. Two days, two waters, the mirror and the rain.
- **Evening**: Light the Mayan firepit. Cook or order a meal to eat slowly by the fire. Kawoq's energy is most alive in the hearth, in the gathering, in the warmth that holds people together. Even alone, you can feel the communal fire. This land has been a hearth for thousands of years.

# Day 3 — 2026-03-23

## Departure

The Obsidian showed you what was true. The Storm washed what needed washing. You leave with two of the most powerful tools the Tzolkin offers: clarity and renewal. Two days is enough — sometimes the most precise cut heals fastest.

### Activities

- **Early Morning**: Write — what did the obsidian mirror show you? What did the storm wash away? These two days held a complete ceremony of truth and renewal.
- **Water Ritual**: Hold water in both hands at Templia's pool or garden. Thank the cenote, the jungle, and the hearth fire for holding space for your transformation. An offering of gratitude to the land of the Maya.
- **Departure**: Leave lighter than you arrived. The blade cut what needed cutting. The rain watered what needed water. The road ahead is clearer now.

# Integration

## Obsidian and Storm: The Complete Ceremony of Truth and Renewal

Two days, two of the most powerful energies in the Tzolkin — and together, a complete ceremony. The sacred calendar does not waste a single day.

- **6 Tijax** (The Obsidian): The flowing balance of the number 6 held the blade steady. Truth arrived without violence — surgical, clear, and ultimately healing. What the obsidian mirror revealed was not punishment but liberation.
- **7 Kawoq** (The Storm): The mystical center of the calendar brought the sacred rain. What the blade had exposed, the water cleansed. The divine feminine of Kawoq does not destroy what it touches — it purifies and makes fertile.

### Closing

The Maya understood that healing requires two movements: the cut that opens and the water that cleanses. Tijax and Kawoq are this ceremony in its purest form. You arrived under the obsidian's honest gaze and you leave under the storm's blessing rain. What was revealed has been washed. What was washed has been made ready. Two days in the land of the Maya, held by the sacred count — this was not a short stay. This was a complete ceremony. Carry what was given. The jungle does not offer what it cannot afford to give.
